# Intro of this repository

Welcome. This repository suppose to be my experiment work.

# Instructions
To push the files you've made to an existing GitHub repository, you'll need to first make sure you have the repository cloned on your local machine. Then you can add your new files to the local repository and push them to the remote repository on GitHub.

Here are the steps you should follow:

- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the local repository on your machine.
- Use the command git add to add your new files to the repository. For example, if your new files are in a directory called "new_files," you would use the command git add new_files/.
- Use the command git commit -m "Your commit message here" to commit the changes to your local repository.
- Use the command git push to push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

You don't need to pull the repository first, but if you have made changes to the remote repository or if you are going to merge the remote with your local, you should pull the repository before you push your changes.

It's also a good practice to git pull to make sure your local repository is up to date with the remote before you push.
